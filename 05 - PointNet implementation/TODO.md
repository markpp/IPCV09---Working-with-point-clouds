# 05 - PointNet implementation

Take a look at the the network architecture in pointnet.png and indentify the corresponding modules in the python implementation.

If possible download and try running an implementation of PointNet e.g. [PyTorch](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch "PointNet in PyTorch") or [Tensorflow](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet "PointNet in Tensorflow"). 
Otherwise you can play around with the recently added PointNet_example.ipynb in google colab. Try switching to another (larger) dataset or adding some data augmentation e.g. rotation.
